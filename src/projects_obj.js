        "Description": "In my class Robotics Studio, we were tasked with creating a walking robot from scratch, from CAD modeling to software. The idea of my partner and I's robot was to essentially be a walking TV, but given a surprising shortage of commercial eScreens, we couldn't completely bring our idea to life. However, we still got our robot to walk at a maximum speed of 14 m/s. \n\n Check out our journey video below!"
